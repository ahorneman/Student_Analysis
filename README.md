# Student_Analysis
##Summary
Some discoveries made while performing my analysis are. Math scores are the average math scores are the highest at Sullivan High school and lowest at Wagner High School. While the average reading score was the higest at Dixon High school and lowest at Sullivan High School. There is a larger budget for public school then charter schools. Some other analysis perfored was on the math scores by grade and 12th graders in public school performed better than those in charter school.
